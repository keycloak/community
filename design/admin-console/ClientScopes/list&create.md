# Client scopes feature in Admin Console
## List

In the new version of Client Scopes feature, not much function changes on the List and Create page, as well as Settings page. To be consistent with the Client scope page in Clients, we got rid of the Default client scope page in the current console and used Change types dropdown to allow users to assign or change client scope types.


### Layout improvements

* No more default client scopes tab
* Using dropdown to change the assigned types.

* Click the inline dropdown to change the assigned type one by one.

### Function changes

* Added a Type field in the form to allow users to choose a type(out of new 4 types) to assign this new client scope.
* Click “Save” to finish creating process and go to the Settings page.

* In the Settings page, the form is the same to Create page. I just added a new label of protocol next to the client’ scope name in the header.
