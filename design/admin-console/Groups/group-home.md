# Groups feature in Admin Console

## Groups home page

In the new Groups feature, we re-done the layout with a flat table, users can click the group name to either drill down or view the details of it. We also re-designed the Move feature by using a simple pop-up table to move a group into another one, instead of clicking the buttons to move.

This is the initial version of Groups feature redesign, changes or updates will be published to this site in later release.
