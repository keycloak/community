# SAML Provider

## Add SAML Provider

Add SAML provider has been simplified to only include the basic settings and the SAML settings.

* The experience of using an entity descriptor has been simplified. If an available descriptor is provided, the metadata will be loaded automatically. Users can complete the configuration very easily.
