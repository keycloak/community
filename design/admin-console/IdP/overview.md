# Identity Providers Redesign

The main update of the Identity providers is to improve the configuration forms, including the creation form as well as the settings form. The creation form has been simplified to only include the basic settings. The advanced settings can be completed after creation.

This website only records the main changes in each function. The whole prototype can be accessed through the following links.
