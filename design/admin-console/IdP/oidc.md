# OIDC Provider

## Add OIDC Provider

Add OIDC provider has been simplified to only include the basic settings and the OIDC settings.

* The experience of using a discovery endpoint has been simplified. If an available endpoint is provided, the metadata will be loaded automatically. Users can complete the configuration very easily.
