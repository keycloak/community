# Realm Settings Redesign

The main change to the Realm settings is some functionalities are added as new tabs.

* Localization - provide the ability to manage the global message bundles (only active in the Master realm) as well as the Realm specific message bundles.
* User registration - This tab collects the configurations that need to be set to the new users. It includes the Default roles (used to belong to the Roles section) and the Default groups (used to belong to the Groups tab) functionalities.
* Event - this is generated from the Event configs. The new Events functionality in Manage is only used to view events. All the configs will be covered by this new tab.

Another update is to the Tokens tab.

* Half of the configurations in Tokens are separated to the new Sessions tab. Users can manage these things differently.
